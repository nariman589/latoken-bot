Programs that use energy poorly are erased by natural and economical selection in competition for limited sources of energy (such as clients’ money). Thus the goal of the program is to use energy in a way that will enable it to use more energy in the future. Simply because programs with other goals are erased by programs with this goal. That is not necessary about conscious goal, programs can have none or little consciousness. Energy is about calories burnt in brains, muscles, engines to manage entropy, eg to build and deliver goods. Thus money is a medium of energy. Each payment triggers burn out of energy to build and deliver goods and services. The monetary equivalent of energy spend due to payments each year is c.$90tn - Gross Global Product. Future money or energy spent is capitalization. Now you know that you are a part of the program evolving to maximize capitalization.
