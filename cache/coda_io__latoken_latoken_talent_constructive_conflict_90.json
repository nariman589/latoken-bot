Today’s Pitching team dispute if we should put investors manually both in Airtable and Strapi resulted in a decision to remove Airtable as a burden. While parsed data should be uploaded to Strapi directly. A CRM will be implemented in the future and be connected with Strapi (or other platform solution). The conflict resulted in the decision which teammates want to commit to. That is a classic example of productive conflict from top management book Five Dysfunctions of a Team ⁠ .
